        "This project aims to develop a specialized Information Retrieval (IR) system for financial question answering, specifically designed to address the \"Filter Bubble\" effect often found in financial domains. Financial queries often require processing heterogeneous data—ranging from official reports to informal microblogs—where high relevance scores often correlate with dominant viewpoints, potentially leading to biased decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our primary research goal is to investigate to what extent a sentiment-diversified re-ranking framework can mitigate the formation of echo chambers without compromising the system's retrieval relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate our research question, the system implements and compares multiple retrieval methods, categorized into standard baselines and advanced neural/diversified approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Baseline Models:**\n",
        "The system utilizes three standard IR baselines to establish a performance benchmark:\n",
        "  * **BM25**: A classic sparse retriever used for efficient first-stage ranking based on keyword overlap.\n",
        "  * **TF-IDF**: A fundamental statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection.\n",
        "  * BM25 + **RM3**: An expansion of the BM25 baseline incorporating the RM3 relevance feedback model to improve retrieval robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Advanced Methods:** Beyond the baselines, three advanced strategies are implemented to handle the complexities of financial jargon and viewpoint diversity:\n",
        "  * **Neural Query Expansion**: Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) as a \"financial persona\" to rewrite natural language queries into jargon-rich versions. This bridges the vocabulary mismatch between layperson users and technical financial documents.\n",
        "  * **Cross-Encoder Re-ranking**: Implements a Neural Cross-Encoder that jointly encodes the query and document. This allows the model to capture deep, fine-grained semantic interactions that standard keyword matching might miss.\n",
        "  * **Sentiment-Diversified Re-ranking**: A greedy re-ranking algorithm that processes the top-ranked documents through a sentiment classifier (labeling them as Positive, Negative, or Neutral). It then re-orders the results to ensure a \"Zig-Zag\" pattern of sentiments (e.g., Bullish vs. Bearish), providing a balanced set of opinions for the user"

Unlike a \"hard\" zig-zag that forces a strict alternation of sentiments (potentially retrieving non-relevant documents), our \"soft\" approach re-scores candidates based on a weighted combination of their original relevance and their contribution to the list's sentiment diversity. We define the score for a candidate document $d$ at rank $k$ as:$$Score(d) = (1 - \\lambda) \\cdot \\text{Relevance}(d) + \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Diversity}(d)$$\n",

The entire point of an emergency fund IS for it to be liquid.  Now I do understand (if you feel your situation requires over 6 months of living expenses): That is a lot of money to have sitting in a statement savings account! Under no circumstances should you take any sort of risk with an emergency fund. However, you COULD do this: Invest some of the assets in a six month, 1 year or 2 year CD if returns were enough to be worthwhile.  If you don't need the money, then fine, great. But if you do, you can break a Certificate of Deposit before maturity. There will be a penalty fee. You might lose interest too. But you'll have access to your money, no liquidity risk. So maybe you could put most, say 60% of your rainy day funds in truly liquid assets. The remainder could be in longer term CD's which you hopefully won't need because you'll be back to non rainy day living again.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The entire point of an emergency fund IS for it to be liquid.  Now I do understand (if you feel your situation requires over 6 months of living expenses): That is a lot of money to have sitting in a statement savings account! Under no circumstances should you take any sort of risk with an emergency fund. However, you COULD do this: Invest some of the assets in a six month, 1 year or 2 year CD if returns were enough to be worthwhile.  If you don't need the money, then fine, great. But if you do, you can break a Certificate of Deposit before maturity. There will be a penalty fee. You might lose interest too. But you'll have access to your money, no liquidity risk. So maybe you could put most, say 60% of your rainy day funds in truly liquid assets. The remainder could be in longer term CD's which you hopefully won't need because you'll be back to non rainy day living again.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "The addition of the Cross-Encoder reranker consistently outperforms the BM25 baseline because it moves beyond simple keyword matching to capture semantic relationships. This system combines the efficiency of sparse retrieval with the precision of dense ranking, significantly boosting metrics like NDCG@10 and MAP.\n",
        "However, this method introduces a substantial computational bottleneck, as the Cross-Encoder must process every query-document pair individually, making it much slower than the initial retrieval. Additionally, there is a risk of domain mismatch; the model is pre-trained on the MS MARCO dataset (general web passages), which may not perfectly align with the specialized financial terminology found in the FIQA dataset. Furthermore, the model likely has a token limit, meaning that despite the code storing 4096 characters, the reranker may truncate the end of longer financial documents, potentially losing critical information located later in the text.\n",

        "Key Findings:\n",
        "* **Relevance Preservation**: The Soft Zig-Zag approach ($\\lambda=0.25$) maintained a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.2032, a negligible decrease from the baseline's 0.2058. This indicates that the system continues to retrieve highly relevant financial information.\n",
        "* **Diversity Gain**: We observed a 6.26% improvement in Shannon Entropy (from 1.184 to 1.258). This confirms that the re-ranker successfully injected diverse viewpoints into the top results, mitigating the filter bubble effect without \"breaking\" the retrieval quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is worth noting that the modest entropy increase reflects a refinement of an already pluralistic system. With a high baseline of 1.18 bits, the retriever was already operating at approximately 75% of the theoretical maximum diversity ($H_{max}=1.585$). Unlike personalization-driven Recommender Systems (RS) that frequently trigger \"Filter Bubbles\" through iterative feedback loops, Information Retrieval (IR) is anchored by objective query relevance, making it structurally more robust against extreme sentiment isolation. Consequently, we can conclude that the modest gain indicates that our framework effectively disrupts sentiment homogeneity while maintaining the system's primary utility as a reliable financial discovery tool.\n",
